A social group's success often depends on its conventionsâ€”shared norms and agreements that guide communication, decision-making, and unity. Strong conventions help navigate challenges, resolve conflicts, and maintain a positive atmosphere, shaping the group's overall success. It's crucial to note that while automation introduces efficiency, it should not disrupt these conventions or alter the fundamental ways people interact and collaborate. Automation should complement and enhance established norms rather than break them, ensuring a seamless integration that preserves the group's cohesiveness.
